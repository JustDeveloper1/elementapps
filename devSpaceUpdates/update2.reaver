  ## 🔄 Update Summary
  
  We’ve rolled out several improvements to make exploring and sharing apps easier and safer:
  
  ---
  
  ### 🔗 App Sharing & Embedding
  
  - You can now **copy a direct link** to any app and share it instantly with others.  
  - New option to **copy the full HTML code** of an app card for embedding or custom usage.
  
  ---
  
  ### 🛡️ Verification Badges
  
  - Apps can now show one of two **verification badges**:
    - ✅ **Verified by DevSpace** – trusted and reviewed apps.
    - ⚠️ **Potentially Dangerous** – flagged for caution.
  
  These badges help users make more informed choices.
  
  ---
  
  ### 🔍 Improved Filtering Logic
  
  - App results are now **sorted by best user ratings first**.
  - If multiple apps have the same rating, those with **more total reviews appear higher**.
  
  This ensures the most trusted and relevant apps are always shown first.
